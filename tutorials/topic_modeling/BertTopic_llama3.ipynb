    "- On XX/XX/year> I had opened a checking account with BMO Bank. I had made a deposit of {$15000.00} the day I had opened the account. After my initial deposit cleared 5-7 days later I was informed that I needed to come down to the bank because they were closing the account due to my credit score being low at which time I was issued a cashiers check from BMO Bank in the amount of {$15000.00} ( the balance of my account. I then took the cashier 's check to BMO Bank ( since they were the bank who issued the check ) and the bank teller informed me that they did not have enough funds to cash it and that I would need to take it to another bank because they do not have enough money to cover it.. This is a serious violation and I will be getting legal assistance regarding this matter. I feel I was discriminated against because of the color of my skin.\n",
    "- On my first visit to the Wells Fargo XXXX location XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to withdraw {$11000.00} from my account. I arrived around XXXX PM, provided all necessary information, and was told the funds were available in my account. A teller appeared unsure and called someone over to verify the transaction. I was asked to sit and wait. By the time XXXX XXXX approached, the bank closed, and I was still waiting. During this time, a police officer asked what I was trying to do. I explained I was simply withdrawing funds already reflected in my account. Ultimately, I was told my funds would take XXXX business days to clear, despite the balance already being visible. \\n\\nThe bank suggested I withdraw {$2000.00} daily from the ATM instead, but I declined for safety reasons, as the area is not secure, and withdrawing in increments seemed unnecessary. I left feeling frustrated but decided to return the following week, as I had another check to deposit. \\n\\nOn my second visit XX/XX/XXXX, I arrived earlier to avoid delays. I deposited {$25000.00} check and again requested to withdraw {$9000.00}. Despite the funds being available, I was subjected to another round of verifications. A teller recognized me from the previous visit, but a XXXX, XXXX XXXX, intervened. XXXX was dismissive, insisted on unnecessary steps, and loudly told me to leave the bank. When I asked for a valid reason why I could not access my funds, she refused to provide XXXX, claiming again that the withdrawal required XXXX business days for approval. \\n\\nI was humiliated as XXXX yelled at me in front of other customers and instructed the police to escort me out. I was not hostile, disrespectful, or disruptive. I simply stood firm on wanting access to my funds. \\n\\nTo confirm this was not standard procedure, I went to another Wells Fargo location at XXXX XXXX, where I successfully obtained a {$21000.00} cashiers check without issue. This clearly demonstrates that my funds were available all along. Tracys actions were unnecessary, discriminatory, and unprofessional. \\n\\nI have been a loyal Wells Fargo customer for years and have never experienced such mistreatment. Her behavior was not only humiliating but also raises questions about fair treatment at this location. I am seeking answers and accountability for this experience. \\n\\nBanking Regulations These laws regulate how banks operate and ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.\n",

    "- On XX/XX/year> I had opened a checking account with BMO Bank. I had made a deposit of {$15000.00} the day I had opened the account. After my initial deposit cleared 5-7 days later I was informed that I needed to come down to the bank because they were closing the account due to my credit score being low at which time I was issued a cashiers check from BMO Bank in the amount of {$15000.00} ( the balance of my account. I then took the cashier 's check to BMO Bank ( since they were the bank who issued the check ) and the bank teller informed me that they did not have enough funds to cash it and that I would need to take it to another bank because they do not have enough money to cover it.. This is a serious violation and I will be getting legal assistance regarding this matter. I feel I was discriminated against because of the color of my skin.\n",
    "- On my first visit to the Wells Fargo XXXX location XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to withdraw {$11000.00} from my account. I arrived around XXXX PM, provided all necessary information, and was told the funds were available in my account. A teller appeared unsure and called someone over to verify the transaction. I was asked to sit and wait. By the time XXXX XXXX approached, the bank closed, and I was still waiting. During this time, a police officer asked what I was trying to do. I explained I was simply withdrawing funds already reflected in my account. Ultimately, I was told my funds would take XXXX business days to clear, despite the balance already being visible. \\n\\nThe bank suggested I withdraw {$2000.00} daily from the ATM instead, but I declined for safety reasons, as the area is not secure, and withdrawing in increments seemed unnecessary. I left feeling frustrated but decided to return the following week, as I had another check to deposit. \\n\\nOn my second visit XX/XX/XXXX, I arrived earlier to avoid delays. I deposited {$25000.00} check and again requested to withdraw {$9000.00}. Despite the funds being available, I was subjected to another round of verifications. A teller recognized me from the previous visit, but a XXXX, XXXX XXXX, intervened. XXXX was dismissive, insisted on unnecessary steps, and loudly told me to leave the bank. When I asked for a valid reason why I could not access my funds, she refused to provide XXXX, claiming again that the withdrawal required XXXX business days for approval. \\n\\nI was humiliated as XXXX yelled at me in front of other customers and instructed the police to escort me out. I was not hostile, disrespectful, or disruptive. I simply stood firm on wanting access to my funds. \\n\\nTo confirm this was not standard procedure, I went to another Wells Fargo location at XXXX XXXX, where I successfully obtained a {$21000.00} cashiers check without issue. This clearly demonstrates that my funds were available all along. Tracys actions were unnecessary, discriminatory, and unprofessional. \\n\\nI have been a loyal Wells Fargo customer for years and have never experienced such mistreatment. Her behavior was not only humiliating but also raises questions about fair treatment at this location. I am seeking answers and accountability for this experience. \\n\\nBanking Regulations These laws regulate how banks operate and ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.\n",
